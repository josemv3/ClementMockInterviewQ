# ClementMockInterviewQ
Mentor mock interview algorithm questions. 

Mentor provided mock interview session. I was given 45 minutes to solve each 
question and then a take-home project to refactor or make the solution more efficient. 
The criteria given for each question were to solve with the simplest answer and make 
several test cases to satisfy potential issues. When complete, my mentor would ask if 
I could improve on the initial solution if time allowed. Each playground shows my second 
solution to make the code more efficient. If there was a follow-up or take-home prompt, 
I added it after my second solution or added another playground.
